> "Transformational leadership:
Transformational Leadership is a leader’s capability to motivate followers by leadership
qualities. According to cf. Avolio ‘Transformational leaders articulate a vision via metaphors, stories, personal reflections, humor, and images, and they tend to speak to the follower’s minds and their sense of purpose rather than to their wallets only’"

>"Transformational Leadership style inﬂuences the followers through stories, humour, personal reﬂection metaphors, and images as compared to the punishments. According to the viewpoints of the transformational 
leadership style, it helps to develop more commitment and motivational level among the employees. According to the previous research on transformational leadership, the organisations may enhance effective performance and productive outcomes (Zhu, Chew, & Span-gler, 2005). According to the Pygmalion effect theory, leaders can inﬂuence the performance of employees through inspirations and expectations. So good expectations can create more good results. Transformational leadership leaders have more expectations from employees through providing more support and encouragement, and create more good results."

>"The support for
hypothesis H2 confirms the idea that a transformational leader whose influence
derives from his/her high levels of professionalism and personal integrity can create an
environment of creativity, trust, commitment, involvement, satisfaction, and excellence
in the organization. In contrast, a transactional leader whose influence derives from
his/her position of authority and his ability to grant rewards and punishments will
succeed in his job in a more limited way (Ehrhart, 2004; Pillai et al., 1999). Support for
H3 is in line with the theoretical idea that transactional behaviors may have a more
negative effect on employees than has been previously recognized in the literature. As
part of the training for their positions, many managers devote a great deal of effort to
acquiring negotiating skills or learning efficiency methods. The findings presented
here indicate that sometimes transactional-style behaviors are perceived by the
employees as negative and opportunistic. These findings support Bass and Avolio’s
(1993), 1993) idea that the effective leader should exhibit a bit of laissez-faire, a
moderate level of transactional leadership, and a high level of transformational
leadership. This mix of leadership styles will strengthen the leader’s ability to
influence his/her employees and spur them on to perform tasks above and beyond
what is required (i.e. OCBs). In addition, the support for H4, which contends that there
is a negative relationship between perceptions of organizational politics and the in-role
performance level and OCB, supports Mintzberg’s (1973) contention that
organizational politics left unchecked can damage employees’ performance."

>"To ensure organization’s success, motivated workforce is required to go beyond their
self-interest by alluring to their higher order needs and morality and it needs
transformational leaders in any organization. It is believed that transformational leaders
have the expertise to bring in, people and the systems on track so there is morality
throughout the organization. As shown by the present research that leadership behaviour
has direct effect on performance of the team, the present study can be moreover
strengthened to explore elements that compose the right balance in leadership behaviours
vital to derive projected yield delivery from team members.
It can be concluded from this research study that the team leaders who exhibit
transformational leadership style accomplish desired results and better team performance
from their team members. In the end, the upcoming researchers should take into account the
limitations that manifested in the present study and they should comply with the
recommendations in future investigation to avert the same limitations."
