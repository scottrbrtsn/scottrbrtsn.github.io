## WAGNI
When am I going to need it?

You've heard of YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it) but what about WAGNI? 

How do we ask the right questions to determine when we ARE going to need it?  

When do we overengineer? 
When do we TDD? 
When is kubernetes justified? 
When should we migrate off the cloud?  
When is microservices justified?
