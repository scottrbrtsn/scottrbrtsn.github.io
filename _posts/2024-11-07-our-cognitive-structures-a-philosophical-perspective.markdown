# WWMD Aphorisms - an introduction
## What would Mason Do (WWMD)

## Intro
- name, relation

With 50 years of experience, Dr. Robertson has formulated a framework to assist his work which he would like to share with you today. 

Before he speaks I'd like to share some examples, where seemingly simple ideas have created a stir of controversy. 

## Copernicus
- Possibly most well known
- Earth -> Sun
- His book and views were banned by Catholic leaders. 
- It took almost 300 years for the ban to be lifted.

## Ignaz Semmelweis

Hungarian physician who was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures.  
In 1847, he proposed hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions at Vienna General Hospital, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards.
The maternal mortality rate dropped from 18% to less than 2%, and he published a book of his findings.

Despite his research, Semmelweis's observations and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. He could offer no theoretical explanation for his findings, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. 

In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis was committed to an asylum by his colleagues. In the asylum, he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later from a wound on his right hand that may have been caused by the beating.

His findings earned widespread acceptance only years after his death.

## Spark: science and the brain - by Dr. John Ratey c. 2008
- AP Biology and HS Human Physiology - claimed nerve cells in the entire CNS do not reproduce.  
- Synaptogenesis and neurogenesis was discovered in rats, and verified in humans, as a result of intense aerobic exercise. 

## Into the  Future
- Many alternative medicines are being discovered to day to have profound effects of synaptogenesis, allowing for new pathways in the brain to form

With this, please allow me to introduce, Dr. Mason Robertson.
