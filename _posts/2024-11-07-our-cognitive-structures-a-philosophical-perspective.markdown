# WWMD Aphorisms - an introduction
## What would Mason Do (WWMD)

## Intro
- name, relation

With 50 years of experience, Dr. Robertson has formulated a framework to assist his work. 
He can cite numerous examples of ideas that are simple, while nonetheless lifesaving. 
Many may contradict or insult current popular opinion.

Before he speaks I'd like to share some examples, where seemingly simple ideas have created a stir of controversy. 

To start, let's review a brief comparision of philosophy. 

### Plato et al...
- Substance
- leads to belief in essence, absolute Truth, certainty, etc...

### Hericlitus
- Change, uncertainty.
- 41: "The river where you set your foot just now is gone."
- Nothing is stable, all is in flux. Whatever you say about anything, its opposite is equally true.
- You cannot know the world in a manner of natural philosophy, or mathematics, or deductive logic. 
- Because, 36: "By cosmic rule... all things change."

## Copernicus
- Earth -> Sun
- His book and views were banned by Catholic leaders. 
- It took almost 300 years for the ban to be lifted.

## Ignaz Semmelweis

Hungarian physician who was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures.  
In 1847, he proposed hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions at Vienna General Hospital, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards.
The maternal mortality rate dropped from 18% to less than 2%, and he published a book of his findings, Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever, in 1861.

Despite his research, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. He could offer no theoretical explanation for his findings of reduced mortality due to hand-washing, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to an asylum by his colleagues. In the asylum, he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later from a gangrenous wound on his right hand that may have been caused by the beating.[4]

His findings earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory, giving Semmelweis' observations a theoretical explanation, and Joseph Lister, acting on Pasteur's research, practised and operated using hygienic methods with great success.

## Spark: science and the brain - by Dr. John Ratey c. 2008
- AP Biology and HS Human Physiology - claimed nerve cells in the entire CNS do not reproduce.  
- Synaptogenesis and neurogenesis was discovered in rats, and verified in humans, as a result of intense aerobic exercise. 

## Into the  Future
- Many alternative medicines are being discovered to day to have profound effects of synaptogenesis, allowing for new pathways in the brain to form
- I find all these ideas fascinating. 

## Conclusion
Who would have thought, simply washing your hands, would have been so insulting.  I hope you find these ideas and this talk tonight, fascinating.  

With this, please allow me to introduce, Dr. Robertson.
