# WWMD Aphorisms - an introduction
## What would Mason Do (WWMD)

## Plato vs Heraclitus
### Plato et al...
- Substance
- leads to belief in essence, absolute Truth, certainty, etc...

### Hericlitus
- Change, uncertainty.
- The whole world is on fire
- 2: "For wisdom, listen not to me but to the Word, and know that all is one."
- 41: "The river where you set your foot just now is gone."
- Nothing is stable, all is in flux. Whatever you say about anything, its opposite is equally true.
- You cannot know the world in a manner of natural philosophy, or mathematics, or deductive logic. 
- Because, 36: "By cosmic rule... all things change."

## Christopher Columbus
- Turns out, did not set out to prove the Earth was round. 
- Apparently, the majority of civilization has believed the earth to have some curved shape for just over 2000 years. 

## Copernicus
- The Catholic Church actually initially cooperated with Copernicus as he had a great relationship with the Church. 
- It was the protestants and poets who stalled the transmission and belief, saying a heliocentric view violated the Bible and was heresy. 
- I'm reminded of Heraclitus. Is it possible, under certain viewpoints, both are true? 
- Catholics, despite the Church having no official stance, eventually joined the masses against Copernicus.
- His book and views were banned by Catholic leaders. 
- It took almost 300 years for the ban to be lifted.

## Ignaz Semmelweis

1 July 1818 â€“ 13 August 1865) was a Hungarian physician and scientist of German descent who was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures and was described as the "saviour of mothers".[2] Postpartum infection, also known as puerperal fever or childbed fever, consists of any bacterial infection of the reproductive tract following birth and in the 19th century was common and often fatal. Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of infection could be drastically reduced by requiring healthcare workers in obstetrical clinics to disinfect their hands. In 1847, he proposed hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions at Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards.[3] The maternal mortality rate dropped from 18% to less than 2%, and he published a book of his findings, Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever, in 1861.

Despite his research, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. He could offer no theoretical explanation for his findings of reduced mortality due to hand-washing, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to an asylum by his colleagues. In the asylum, he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later from a gangrenous wound on his right hand that may have been caused by the beating.[4]

His findings earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory, giving Semmelweis' observations a theoretical explanation, and Joseph Lister, acting on Pasteur's research, practised and operated using hygienic methods with great success.

## Life Itself - by Robert Rosen c. 1991
- A mathematical approach to the study of biology and life. 
- Traditional science applies a reductionist approach, attempting to understand the whole, by reconstructing it from its most basic parts.
- It was believed, the only approach to study life, was to apply the Cartesian metaphor (organism as machine).
- However, Rosen argues reductionism does not work in biology, and ignores the complexity of organisms. 
- Rosen defines a "complex system" as any system that cannot be  fully understood by reducing it to its parts.
- This is very similar to the idea of Gestalt: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 

## Spark: science and the brain - by Dr. John Ratey c. 2008
- AP Biology and HS Human Physiology - claimed nerve cells in the entire CNS do not reproduce.  
- Synaptogenesis and neurogenesis was discovered in rats, and verified in humans, as a result of intense aerobic exercise. 

## Into the  Future
- Many alternative medicines are being discovered to day to have profound effects of synaptogenesis, allowing for new pathways in the brain to form
- I find all these ideas fascinating.
