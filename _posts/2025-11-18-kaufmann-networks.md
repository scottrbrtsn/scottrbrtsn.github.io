[Stuart Kauffmann's NK model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK_model)

```
This suggests a very simple approach to identifying complexity. 
Simply count the things --> N
Count the connections between the things --> K

Now you have a general idea of how complex things are.
As these numbers increase, things are more complex. 

Where is your system trending?  

What other simple things can you count to understand your system dynamics?  
```

For another example, see [an old post on simple metrics from git](https://scottrbrtsn.github.io/2025/11/10/git.html).
