# Nobody Cares 
People don't care if you used AI to build your shiny new thing. 

People don't care if it runs on kubernetes, globally across multi-az's in a hybrid cloud to avoid vendor lock-in, or in your mom's basement because you never needed the cloud in the first place.  

People don't care how many gpus you bought last year.  

Just like most people don't care enough to read this post. 

If you are still reading, 1. thank you, and 2. we need ask ourselves: Are we making things better for other people?  Or, are we making things worse?

If we are only concerned about the auto-scaling configuration of our kafka cluster, the self-managed backpressure on our flink processing pipelines, or the size of the next gpu cluster we are going to need given the target model size for AI training, fine-tuning, and inference...

Are we asking the right questions?
