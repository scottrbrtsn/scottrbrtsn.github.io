## The Things I Carry

- Enthusiasm for the intersection between cognitive science and computer science.
- Hands on experience supporting human factors and Industrial Organizational Psychologists.
- Deep application of sports psychology principles (psychology of performance, team performance measurement and improvement, leadership strategies and its effects on performance).
- A wide net, inundated and overflowing with technologies, from legacy Windows desktop systems to modern cloud native "silver bullets," to GPU/HPC environments, I haven't seen it all, but I've seen a lot. 
- High level appreciation for complexity science as it applies to software systems and the organizations within which they are built.  

The drive to rise above Sisyphean life.

## Values
- Operating under self-imposed constraint `--yields->` tighter cycles, faster feedback, and the compounding interest in performance as a result of adaptation from stress. 
- Bias for simplicity  `--yields->` a reduction in complexity, cognitive load, and more straightforward constraints.
- Local Driven Development `--yields->` a shift left mindset, simplifying development, enabling optimal constraints. 
- WAGNI (i.e. When are you going to need it) `--yields->` a balance of all the above.  Applying solutions at the point when it makes the most sense to do so, i.e. not to early, and not to late. 
- Sound metrics -yield-> the answers to the question of WAGNI.  A data driven approach to identify when decisions can be made, and what the best answer might be.  
- Servant leadership `--yields->` a sacrifice of pride, arrogance, and self for the greater organization, enabling sound metrics and support instead of promotion driven development and gamified KPI metrics.

## Work Experience (and some wins)
#### ATA, LLC 
#### Senior Software Engineer **06/2022 –Present**
  - Participated in grassroots developer culture incubation emphasizing applications of complexity science and cognitive load theory to support comprehensive sociotechnical approaches to software projects.
  - Measured developer churn with commit counts to prove 70% of efforts were spent managing, adjusting, and refactoring deployment configuration over 30% actual value in business solutions to the customer. 
  - Created a Slack channel "kaizen" as a means to disseminate and influence developer productivity and happiness.
  - Questioned the utility of "mandatory full time pair programming," aligning the team, improving psychological safety, and carving time for individual deep work.
  - Nominated to team lead over others with more tenure.
  - Communicated up the chain: the cost of context switching, cognitive load, and poor communication as contributors to burnout.  
  - Attracted, hired, and retained multiple team members.

#### COLSA, Corp 
#### Artificial Intelligence Software Engineer **07/2020 –06/2022**
  - Applied software engineering fundamentals to assist machine learning engineers with model training and serving.  Realized up to 80% performance improvement in pipeline run times. 
- Dynetics - Software Engineer (04/2019 –07/2020)
  - supported a revitalization of the SDLC, improving developer happiness and productivity, with 80% reduction in unnecessary meetings.

#### SAIC 
#### Senior Software Engineer – Data Collection Lead **01/2018 –04/2019**
  - Deployed distributed software engineering solutions alongside science-backed training effectiveness techniques for data collection systems to enable automated performance measurement and accelerate the schedule of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT).
  - During iteration 0, witnessed 75% student pilot graduation rate in half the time (6 months compared to the standard 12), and 90% within 7 months. 
  - Contributed to "Best Paper" at I/ITSEC 2018 by applying decades old experience in literature and APA publication review, and including my experience in the University of Iowa's "Quantitative Training Effectiveness Assessment" platform as it had been evolved into Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) training environments.

#### Software Engineer Specialist **01/2016 – 01/2017** 
#### SWEAP Apprentice **Summers, 2015 & 2016**
  - Benefited from the example of bottom-up leadership: support from senior engineers, guidance and guardrails from architects, a mature SDLC and CI/CD implementation with little to no friction between the 100+ developers supporting the thousands of users, as well as executive leadership developing direct relationships even with an entry level engineer like myself.
  - Observed weekly deployment schedules with little to no hangup of a set of microservices alongside the web service and iOS mobile application the services supported.  
  - Attended regular deep dives of new approaches to software engineering, beginning my career of life-long-learning in tech. 

#### NolaBots - Robotics Team Mentor **08/2016 – 01/2018**
  - Exercised my passion for technology and youth development.
  - Observed a high school student autonomously implementing object oriented programming and automating the robot to score points in addition to manual intervention during the First Robotics Competition.
