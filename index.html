        <h1>A GREAT DAY</h1>
            Help me train and overcome: three races,
        three distances, three locations.  See
        <a href="https://www.spartan.com/en/community/blog/spartan-news?article=44998">www.spartan.com</a>
        for more details.<br>
        <br>

        <h2>Why?</h2>

            I believe in standards of character. <br>
        <br>
        ...discipline, perseverance, self-control...<br>
        <br>

            I believe in the human spirit. <br>
        <br>
        ...transcendence, miraculous victory, the obliteration of evil...<br>
        <br>

            And I believe the men and women who exercise these values through their military service
        and sacrifice embody these beliefs in such a way that deserves recognition.<br>
        <br>

        </h2>
            You may not support our military and its grandiose aims, so I ask you to remember the
        individual soldier who may not either, but loses their limbs or life because they believe
        your freedom and safety matters. This is not about a country‚Äôs political aims.
        It is about the upstanding character it takes to serve.  I support these values and I support
        the cultivation and embodiment of them.  So I challenge myself to exercise them in this manner.

        If my goal is met, a percentage will send me to race, and the rest will go towards the charities below.
        You will receive a thank you gift TBD.  Minimum costs include $325 for the trifecta pass and any transportation
        or lodging.  I should really only need to stay overnight in Dallas so this extra cost is actually minimal.
        Should a significant number of you actually support me, I will add the Fayetteville and West Point Sprints
        to the list.

            <h2>Or,</h2>
