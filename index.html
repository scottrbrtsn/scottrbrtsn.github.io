        A great day,

        I bring you a personal challenge, one I‚Äôm challenging myself with, and I welcome you to join me: I plan to earn a trifecta, three races, three distances, three locations.  See https://www.spartan.com/en for more details. To add to that, I am only choosing locations associated with military bases, known as the Honor Series.

        Why?

        I believe in standards of character. Those which I strive to adhere to and humbly fall short: discipline, perseverance, self-control...

        I believe in the human spirit, as it may be the most precious gift we possess: transcendence, miraculous victory, crouching the odds...

        And I believe the men and women who exercise these values through their military service and sacrifice embody these beliefs in such a way that deserves recognition.

        You may not support our military and its grandiose aims, so I ask you to remember the individual soldier who may not either, but loses their limbs or life because they believe your freedom and safety matters. This is not about a country‚Äôs political aims.  It is about the upstanding character it takes to serve.  I support these values and I support the cultivation and embodiment of them.  So I challenge myself to exercise them in this manner.

        Still reading?  Here‚Äôs how you can join me:

        Support from a distance: please mail donations to support my pursuit of a trifecta.  If my goal is met, a percentage will send me to race, and the rest will go towards the charities below.  You will receive a thank you gift TBD.  Minimum costs include $325 for the trifecta pass and any transportation or lodging.  I should really only need to stay overnight in Dallas so this extra cost is actually minimal.  Should a significant number of you actually support me, I will add the Fayetteville and West Point Sprints to the list.

        Support locally:
        Help me train or participate with me.  Come watch the event.  Stop by and drop off some funds.  Share a recovery beverage after a workout.  üçª
