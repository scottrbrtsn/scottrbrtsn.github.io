        <h1>A GREAT DAY</h1>
            Help me train and overcome: three races,
        three distances, three locations.  See
        <a href="https://www.spartan.com/en/community/blog/spartan-news?article=44998" target="_blank">www.spartan.com</a>
        for more details.<br>
        <br>

        <h1>Why?</h1>

            We believe in standards of character. <br>
        <br>
        ...discipline, perseverance, self-control...<br>
        <br>

            We believe in the human spirit. <br>
        <br>
        ...transcendence, miraculous victory, the obliteration of evil...<br>
        <br>

            And WE believe the men and women who exercise these values through their military service
        and sacrifice embody these beliefs in such a way that deserves recognition.<br>
        <br>

        </h2>
            I ask you to remember the individual soldier, the son, the daughter, the brother, or sister,
        who risks losing their limbs or life because they believe
        your freedom and safety matter. This is not about our country‚Äôs political aims.
        It is about the upstanding character it takes to serve.  I support these values and I support
        the cultivation and embodiment of them.

        If my goal is met, a percentage will send me to race, and the rest will go towards the charities below.
        You will receive a thank you gift TBD.  Minimum costs include $325 for the trifecta pass and any transportation
        or lodging.  I should really only need to stay overnight in Dallas so this extra cost is actually minimal.
        Should a significant number of you actually support me, I will add the
        <a href="https://www.spartan.com/en/race/detail/3425" target="_blank">Fayetteville</a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.spartan.com/en/race/detail/2460" target="_blank">West Point Sprints</a>
        to the list.
