## Individually Sovereign AI 
- Cloud deployments, SaaS offerings, are a long term cost risk.
- Non-local AI is a blatant security risk.  
- Small language models ~0.6-8B models offer significantly less compute requirements (can run on a laptop) while competing with industry leaders for your use case.  
- Leverage expertise for your small business and we can get started leveraging the next wave of AI: the one where you own the entire system end - to - end. 

## Architecture analysis  
- Different from your standard solution architecture.
- Analyze your current system architecture.
- Map your organization to the current implementation model.
- Offerings for transition plans.

## Cloud exit
- Cloud offers businesses the opportunity to experiment at low cost. 
- Long term costs balloon at scale.
- Migrating out of the cloud, once you have a stable market fit, could save significant risk to your business.
